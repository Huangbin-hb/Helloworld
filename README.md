my first repository in GitHub

Hi GitHub!
  My name is Bin huang . I am from Meizhou city Guangdong province China, taking my master's degree in educational technology at South China Normal University now. I have learnt java programming language since June 12th 2015. I am very confuse by the debug during coding my code on Eclipse, so that I need help from you.
